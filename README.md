## Doubly chained list

A doubly linked list is a type of chained list that can be empty or that can have one or more nodes, with each node having two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node
The current project consists of a basic implementation of a doubly chained list.

The program is developed in the C programming language

#### The program provides 7 options
1 - Insert. 
</br>2 - Show. 
</br>3 - Search. 
</br>4 - Change. 
</br>5 - Delete 1 element. 
</br>6 - Delete all. 
</br>0 - Finish.

For the current project, we have taken as a basis the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. I found some problems with no apparent solution running in Clion.
