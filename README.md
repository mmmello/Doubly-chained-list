## Doubly chained list

A doubly linked list is a type of chained list that can be empty or that can have one or more nodes, with each node having two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node
The current project consists of a basic implementation of a doubly chained list.

The program is developed in the C programming language.

### The program provides 7 options
<ul>
  <li>Insert</li>
  <li>Show</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Change</li>
  <li>Delete 1 element</li>
  <li>Delete all</li>
  <li>Finish</li>
</ul>

For the current project, we have taken as a basis the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. I found some problems with no apparent solution running in Clion.
